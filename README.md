# Osmosis-Whale-Alerts :whale2:
This repository contains a Twitter bot that Tweets transaction details for transactions worth more than $10,000 USD that occur on [Osmosis Zone](https://osmosis.zone/). Osmosis is a popular DEX within the Cosmos Ecosystem, referred to some as the liquidity hub of the Cosmos.  

## Aims :dart:

The aim of this application is to monitor large transactions that take place on Osmosis. 

Right now, this bot utilizes [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) Osmosis data to monitor transactions. Flipside Crypto does not provide live data, but data on a 12 hour delay. So transactions will not alert automatically via the bot, but within the same day.  

## Setup :hammer:

#### Flipside Crypto

To access the Flipside Crypto dataset, you will need a [ShroomDK API Key](https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk). This API key is free to obtain and use once you mint it as an NFT on ETH mainnet. Ensure you have some ETH in your Metamask as gas for the minting transaction. 

#### Twitter

This bot requires a Twitter Developer Account with Elevated Access. To request elevated access, first create the Twitter account you wish to send the tweets and request elevated access through the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://apps.twitter.com/). Once your access has been approved, create a new application on the Twitter developer portal and generate a consumer key and consumer secret.
